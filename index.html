		<h1>Nightmare</h1>
	<p>You're in the forest laying in the backseat of the car. A creature is breaking in through the windscreen. While you're processing the situation and figuring out what to do, the creature breaks in. As it charges over to 
	you, somebody from the outside attacks the creature. What will you do at that moment? </p>

	
	<h2> You run out the car.</h2>
